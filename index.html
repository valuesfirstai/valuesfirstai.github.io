              <p><b>Participatory design is essential for creating value-aligned technology.</b>
              <br>Values define who we aspire to be and how we want to live.  We believe that the challenge of creating value-aligned technology is not just technical, but human. 
              In the real world, values are complex, idiosyncratic and context-dependent.   Our approach is to design technology by involving users from the very beginning to deeply understand their values and needs. </p>

              <p><b>The use of AI should be judicious and transparent.</b>
              <br>We care about where, how and how much AI is used.   Our goal is to provide transparency on the adoption of AI solutions, by documenting how AI-related design decisions are made and the  
              tradeoffs against the alternatives. </p>

              <p><b>The benefits and risks of AI need to addressed not only at the model level, but also the interface level.</b>
              <br>Creating real impact does not necessarily mean training better and bigger models.  Through creative design of how users interact with an AI system, we can amplify the benefits of an AI model and better mitigate its risks.</p>

            <p>In today's globalized society, there are more people in transition than ever <code>&#8212;</code> immigrants, refugees, international students, and temporary foreign workers.   Life transitions are difficult; moving to a new country requires one to quickly navigate the systems,
              understand the local culture, overcome language barriers and combat feelings of social isolation.  </p>
            <p>We are creating the Newcomer App, an <b>AI-powered solution for multi-lingual and hyper-local resource navigation</b>.  Our goal is that the app will provide newcomers with a sense of control and agency, a way to make social and professional connections, and enough know-how to take concrete actions to improve different aspects of their well-being. </p>
