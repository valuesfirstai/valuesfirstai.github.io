      <h1>What We Do</h1>
      <div>
        <p>We design and develop AI-powered interactive systems for social good, bring AI solutions to the non-profit world and introduce value sensitive design processes to AI development. </p>

          <strong>Design and Develop AI-Powered Interactive Systems for Social Good</strong>
          <p>Understanding users -- their values, challenges, perception of AI -- is an important first step in product development that gets ignored.   We provide consulting services to help startups engage target end-users from the get-go; these services might include interviews, co-design sessions and surveys.  Our work includes a summary of findings and suggestions for new directions. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Bring AI Solutions to the Non-Profit World </strong>
          <p>We are interested in working with organizations, especially non-profits, who are trying to create social change, but missing the technology piece.  We provide a low-cost service which includes conducting contextual inquiries to understand your organization's needs, designing a proof-of-concept prototype, and collaborating on funding applications. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Introduce Value-Sensitive Design to AI Development</strong>
          <p>AI technology is powerful, yet also environmentally cost.  Not all technology solutions need to adopt AI, and the adoption of AI always come with some risks.  We conduct risk-benefit analysis of AI adoption for your technology from a human-centered design perspective.</p>
