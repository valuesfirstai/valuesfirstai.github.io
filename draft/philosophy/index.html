        <h2>Complexity of Human Values</h2>
        <p>Values, in the broadest sense, are beliefs about what are important and moral, that shape our attitudes and motivate our behaviour.  One can also think of values as ideals, namely, <b>who we aspire to be</b> and <b>how we want to live</b>.  In reality, there is always a gap between our aspirations and the reality.  First, the optimal action that best benefits us in a given situation may not align with our values.  For example, we might aspire to be honest, but tell lies when they are in our best interest. Second, our beliefs about what values we hold are often opaque to ourselves, simply because we have not explicitly thought much about our values.  For example, we might believe in equality, but find ourselves applying different standards when confronted with different situations (e.g., distribution of food vs scholarship awards). Third, real life constraints---which can be social, economical, political---create value tension, forcing us to re-assess the priorities of different values that we hold simultaneously.  

          This book is about how technology can be designed to fill this gap, by helping us achieve the best version of ourselves individually and as a society, and reasons for why this endeavour of designing technology for human values is challenging and complex..</p>
