          <h1>The Newcomer App</h1>
          <p>The Newcomer App is an AI-powered, multi-lingual and hyper-local resource navigation platform for newcomers.  
          <br><br>Our mission is to create an app that can help newcomers - immigrants, refugees, international students - navigate their transition to a new country and improve their overall well-being.

        <h2>What is the Problem?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        Everywhere in the world, people are on the move.  There is a steady increase of immigrants, refugees and international students settling in new countries. Canada, for instance, is aiming to welcome 500,000 new immigrants per year by 2025, of which around 75,000 are expected to be refugees.
        
        <br><br>Research has revealed the "Healthy Immigrant Effect‚Äù (Newbold, 2006), showing that Immigrants arrive in Canada healthier than non-immigrants, but the longer they live in Canada, the more they lose this health advantage.  
        
        <br><br>
        Several social determinants of health factors contribute to declining health outcomes, such as unemployemnt (due to qualification not being recognized), language barrier, lack of social connection, unaffordable housing, reduction of mobility, experiences of discrimination, etc.

        <h2>How did we explore the problem?</h2>
        <p>The project started in May 2023 as an intiative at University of Waterloo, in partnership with the KW4 Ontario Health Team and supported by the Graham Seed Fund.</p>

          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <p>In Summer 2023, we interviewed 50 with immigrants and refugees in 9 different languages and members of 16 newcomer-serving organizations. Newcomers were asked to rank the capabilities that are most important to them, discuss how these capabilities have evolved as a result of their move to Canada. </p>

          <h3>Co-Design</h3>
          <p>In Fall 2023, we invited 29 newcomers and 6 organizations to meet at a local library to brainstorm features for the app. The goal is to gather diverse design ideas, without participants having to worry about technically feasibility. </p>

          <h3>Prototype Development</h3>
          <p>From Jan-April 2024, we developed a prototype to address four major needs of newcomers: the need for knowledge, connections, self-expression and ability to manage the bigger picture.  We presented a demo at the World Summit AI Conference in Montreal in April.</p>

        <br><br>The Newcomer App prompts users to take actions, provide suggestions and allow them to ask questions, all in their own language.
