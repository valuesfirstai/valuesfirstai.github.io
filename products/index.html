            <p>Everywhere in the world, people are on the move.
            <p>There has been a steady increase of immigrants, refugees and international students settling in new countries. Canada, for instance, is aiming to welcome 500,000 new immigrants by 2026, including refugees.</p>
          
            <p>Research has revealed the "Healthy Immigrant Effect‚Äù (Newbold, 2006), showing that Immigrants arrive in Canada healthier than non-immigrants, but the longer they live in Canada, the more they lose this health advantage.</p>
            
            <p>Social determinants of health factors contribute to declining health outcomes; these include language barrier, social isolation, unaffordable housing, discrimination, difficulty finding family doctors, and work that comensurates with one's qualification.
