          <h1>The Newcomer App</h1>
          <p>The Newcomer App is an AI-powered, multi-lingual and hyper-local resource navigation platform for newcomers.  
          <br><br>Our mission is to crate an app that would help newcomers - immigrants, refugees, international students - navigate their transition to Canada, with a special focus on social determinants of health.  
          <br><br>The project started in May 2023 as an intiative at University of Waterloo, in partnership with the KW4 Ontario Health Team and supported by the Graham Seed Fund.

        <h2>What is the Problem?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        Everywhere in the world, people are on the move.  In Canada, there is a steady increase of immigrants, refugees and international students settling in the country. This trend will likely continue - Canada is aiming to welcome 500,000 new immigrants per year by 2025, of which around 75,000 are expected to be refugees.
        
        <br><br>Immigrants tend to be healthier than non-immigrants upon arrival in Canada. However, across every immigration category, the longer they live in Canada the more their health deteriorates; this experience of arriving with a health advantage and losing it over time has been called the "Healthy Immigrant Effect” (Newbold, 2006).  
        <br><br>Several factors contribute to declining health outcomes among immigrants, such as income levels, official language proficiency, circumstances of arrival (e.g., refugees who experienced oppression, conflict, violence and persecution), unfair treatment or discrimination, health literacy and ability to integrate.

          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <p>In May-August 2023, we completed interviews with 50 with immigrants and refugees in 9 different languages and 16 newcomer-serving organizations. Newcomers were asked to rank the capabilities that are most important to them, discuss how these capabilities have evolved as a result of their move to Canada. </p>

          <h3>Co-Design</h3>
          <p>In Oct-Nov 2023, we invited 29 newcomers and 6 organizations to meet at a local library to clarify the problem context and to brainstorm features for the app. The goal is to gather diverse design ideas, without participants having to worry whether it is technically feasible or not. </p>

          <h3>Feature Design</h3>
          <p>From Jan-April 2024, we developed the first version of our prototype based on four main challenges that we discovered through interviews and co-design; these include the need for knowledge, connections, self-expression and the capability to manage the bigger picture.  We presented this prototype at the World Summit AI Conference in Montreal in April 25-26.</p>

        <h2>How are we solving the problem?</h2>
        <p>At the core, the Newcomer App is a goal-setting tool that prompts users to choose aspects of well-being to work on, provides them suggested actions and relevant resources to complete the actions, and provides them with language support so that they can ask further questions in their own language about how to complete those actions.  Open-sourced AI models are used in various app features, for personalized recommendation, language translation and question answering.  Below is a sneak peak of the current Newcomer App.</p>
